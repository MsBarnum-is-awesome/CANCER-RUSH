## Save Lives Now

[DONATE TO ST.JUDE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TODAY](https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html)

St. Jude Children's hospital is a hospital dedicated to children with cancer. They need your help to save the lives of these children. Please click on the link to make a generous offer of either $25 or more. I have also created a fun game linked below. Enjoy and please remember:

"If you think that one person can't make a difference try sleeping with a mosquito."
-Dalai Lama

In this game you are collecting numbers and solving math problems. Further explaining will also be in the game so read carefully!
